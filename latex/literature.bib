  abstract = {The particle simulation library AutoPas implements many algorithms with vastly different performance characteristics to solve the pairwise short-range particle interactions in molecular dynamics simulations. During the simulation, it uses black-box optimization techniques to automatically select the fastest algorithm for the current state. While they are able to find good algorithms eventually, they often try highly unsuitable ones at the start due to lack of initial per- formance information. As some algorithms perform orders of magnitude worse than the optimum for a given simulation state, this has a significant negative impact on the time to solution.
              In this project, we gather knowledge about the performance characteristics of the algorithms through theoretical modeling, profiling, and benchmarking. We make the results available through a new white-box optimization strategy that is able to apply any domain-specific knowledge during optimization. It removes those algorithms from the candidate list that likely perform worst in the current simulation state. In our tests, removing the five percent slowest algorithms reduced the tuning time by up to 80 percent while still finding the best algorithm. Furthermore, we give insights and recommendations what can be done to potentially improve the performance further.

  abstract = {AutoPas is a high-performance, auto-tuned particle simulation library for many-body systems, capable of dynamically switching between algorithms and data structures to guarantee optimal performance throughout the simulation.
              This thesis introduces a novel fuzzy logic-based tuning strategy for AutoPas, allowing users to guide the tuning process by specifying custom Fuzzy Systems, which can be used to efficiently prune the search space of possible parameter configurations. Efficient tuning strategies are crucial, as they allow for discarding poor parameter configurations without evaluating them, thus reducing tuning time and improving overall library performance.
              We demonstrate that a data-driven approach can automatically generate Fuzzy Systems that significantly outperform existing tuning strategies on specific benchmarks, resulting in speedups of up to 1.96x compared to the FullSearch Strategy on scenarios included in the training data and up to 1.35x on scenarios not directly included.
              The Fuzzy Tuning Strategy can drastically reduce the number of evaluated configurations during tuning phases while achieving comparable tuning results, making it a promising alternative to the existing tuning strategies.

  abstract = {AutoPas is an open-source C++ library delivering optimal node-level performance by providing the ideal algorithmic configuration for an arbitrary scenario in a given short-range particle simulation. It acts as a black-box container, internally implementing an extensive set of algorithms, parallelization strategies, and optimizations that are combined dynamically according to the state of the simulation via auto-tuning. This paper gives an overview of the high-level user perspective, as well as the internal view, covering the implemented techniques and features. The library is showcased by incorporating it into the codes LAMMPS and ls1 mardyn, and by investigating various applications. We further outline node-level shared-memory performance and scalability of our auto-tuning software which is comparable to LAMMPS.

Depending on the nature of the scenario, its current state, and the forces of interest, the optimal algorithm configuration can differ greatly. Choosing this optimum is a non-trivial task even for experts. Furthermore, this optimum can change over the course of a simulation. Typically, a particle simulation software only implements one algorithm for force computation and is thus specialized for a certain type of simulation. It is up to the user to choose the program suitable for his needs. Solution method: The AutoPas library implements a range of state of the art algorithms to find the relevant neighbors for the N-Body pairwise force calculation. It provides multiple shared-memory parallelization strategies using OpenMP and further algorithm optimization parameters that can all be set at run-time. A big burden for users persists in requiring the expert knowledge to pick the optimal solution procedure for a simulation. AutoPas removes this burden by tuning all aforementioned options automatically and dynamically. This way, simulation programs that make use of AutoPas give every domain scientist the possibility to make use of the most suitable algorithm configuration for arbitrary scenarios.}

  abstract     = {The large computational cost of pairwise force calculations within Molecular Dynamics requires the use of specialist algorithms, such as Linked Cells or Verlet Lists, as well as efficient ways of parallelising such algorithms. There is, however, no ``silver bullet'' best algorithm for all simulations, and the best algorithm can change over the course of a simulation.
                  AutoPas is a node-level particle simulation library that aims to dynamically select the most optimal algorithm, vectorisation strategy, and shared memory parallelism for a given metric, such as time for force calculation [F. Gratl et al, N ways to simulate short-range particle systems: Automated algorithm selection with the node-level library AutoPas, 2022]. In multi-node HPC systems, each node has their own AutoPas container, making it's own tuning decisions. Practically, this autotuning requires trialling algorithms during the course of the simulation, however trialling slow algorithms can provide significant overhead, and so smart tuning strategies must be developed that can select optimal, or close to optimal, performance, with minimal overhead.
                  In this poster, we will discuss how statistical techniques such as Bayesian Optimisation, Gaussian Process Models, and Reinforcement Learning can be adapted into smart tuning strategies within AutoPas. To support our claims, we present results using our smart tuning strategies applied to the field of Molecular Dynamics.},
